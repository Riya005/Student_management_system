Create a C-Based, linux command-line application tailored for a specific academic club, offering essential services such as registration, search, update, and delete operations with generatable user requests.

Operation Implementation: Develop the application to support four fundamental operations: registration, search, update, and delete. Each operation will have a designated operation ID (0 for registration, 1 for search, 2 for update, 3 for delete).

The skills required are Linked list and File Handling, makefile, and shell scripting.
